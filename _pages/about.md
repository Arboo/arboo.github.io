My name is WANG QIUYI. 

I majored in *Data Science* at *Shanghai University of Finance and Economics*, and I am pursuing my master's degree in *Quantitative Finance* at *National University of Singapore*. Currently, I am based in Shanghai. 

I am passionate about expanding my knowledge in the fields of data science and quantitative finance. I will update this website with my learning progress and thoughts. Apart from that, I enjoy reading, writing, photography, and traveling. Feel free to reach out and exchange ideas with me.
